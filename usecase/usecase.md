Current problem and existing solutions
Art forgery - Art forgery is the creating and selling of works of art which are falsely credited to other, usually more famous artists.
Below are some of the ways of doing forgery

- Sometimes, an original item is borrowed or stolen from the owner in order to create a copy. Forgers will then return the copy to the owner, keeping the original for himself.
- Forgers would create false paper trails to make the art work genuine.
- Dealers would try to make profit on a forged art by selling it as genuine.
- Some times, dealer would withdraw the forged art and quitely returns it to owner, thus giving him an option to sell elsewhere.

Current Problems: Two of the bigger problems in the art work is to establish 'Authenticity' and 'Provenence'.

- Establish the provenence of the art work : Provence refers to the ownership history of the artwork. Its trail of the ownership which leads to the artists who created the art work.
  Currently, provevnece is mostly managed manually by the current owner who has to maintain trails of all the previous owner's record.
- Establish the authenticity of the art work
- photographic forgery - The possession of the photo-negatives would allow a forger to print an unlimited number of fake prints, which he could then pass off as original. Fake prints would be nearly indistinguishable from originals, if the same photographic paper was used.

  Existing Solutions : Below are the ways to detect the art forgery

- Determines the art work provenence. If item has no paper trail then its most likely forged work.
- Thorough examination of piece to understand artistics tool and methods used and comparing it with the time line of original artist to determine the authenticity of art.
- Forensic authentication
- Digital authentication

How Blockchain can help

Blockchain can be used to maintain a single source of truth which is immutable and decentralized. It can be used to capture each and every authorship and ownership records of the artworks as a block along with current timestamp and other necessary details. Thus, any one can verify and track every movement of the artwork leading to its provenence.
Physical artwork:
One way is to use NFC chip in the artwork and let it stores the private key and stores public key on to blockchain. With this model, any one can scan the chip to ascertain the authenticity of the artwork.
Digital artwork:
Second way is to leverage third party solution of using digital token as a representation of the art work.
Artist has to send the pic of the artwork with all the associated info to these copmpanies to get the digital token. These art details are captured as a block in the blockchaina nd this digital token represents the 'certificate of authenticity'. When artwork is sold, artist transfers the digital token along with the artwork to the new owner. This transaction is digitally recorded as a seperatwe block in the blockchain.

Advantages and disadvantages of using a blockchain solution.

Biggest problem in ArtWork
Two of the bigger problems in the art work is to establish 'Authenticity' and 'Provenence'. We can use blockchain solution to deal with it.

provenence and authentication - Provence refers to the ownershop history of the artwork. Its trail of the ownership which leads to the artists who created the art work.
Curently, provevnece is mostly managed manually by the current owner who has to maintain trails of all the previous owner's record.

Advantages:

- Provides provenence : Blockchain can be used to maintain a single source of truth which is immeutable and decentralized. It can be used to capture each and every authorship and ownership records of the artworks as a block along with current timestamp and other necessary details. Thus, any one can verify and track every movement of the artwork leading to its provenence.
- provides financial gain to Artist : Currently, an artist only makes a profit when they initially sell a piece of artwork. Auction house drives up prices to get profit but does not pass the profit margin to artist. But by registering the art work with blockchain, artist would have the ability to get the profi margin for each of the sale.
- Democratization : At the moment, only someone with vast wealth can buy and collect expensive artwork. But registering it on the blockchain allows for fractional ownership. Thus a costly art would have thousands of investor who holds fraction of margin in the art and can trade on its value over time.
- Allow financial strength to art museam - Democratization can also help art museam to finance the new art works by auctioning off shares of their existing collection.

Disadvantages :

- Blocklchain adoption would directly impact all the middleman like auction house and galleries, who makes huge profit from the artwork sale. Right now, auction house drives up the art work prices drastically to get the profit . AFter blockchain implementation, on a mutual agreement, they have to share the profit with the artist and other entities too.
